# Chat Calculator

## Motivation:
This might seem like a simple task, yet it is equipped with OpenAI API function calling abilities that makes the calculation of mathematical expressions accurate enough, unlike chatgpt.

## Errors:
I have found the errors below generated by chatgpt, when asked for evaluating some of the expressions. Therefore, I tried to mitigate the problem using new function calling abilities of OpenAI chatcompletion API.

**Curious to try it. Follow the steps below:**
```bash
    bash init_setup.sh
    conda activate ./env
    cd ChatCalculator
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    chainlit run app.py -w
```
add the OpenAI API key to the `.env` file in the parent directory.
